# EMPC using attention-based RNN for disturbance prediction

This repository contains software that complements the paper titled "Control of Wastewater Treatment Plants using Economic-Oriented MPC and Attention-Based RNN Disturbance Prediction Models."

It includes several folders: the "Controller" folder holds the files for the controller implementation, the "Influent Files" folder contains the files representing the inlet flow profiles, the "Predictions" folder stores the CSV files with influent flow rate predictions produced by the RNN models, and the "BSM Auxiliary Files" folder includes the files required for the BSM model.

The standard Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) can be downloaded from the link below:
