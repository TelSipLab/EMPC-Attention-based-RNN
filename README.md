# EMPC using attention-based RNN for disturbance prediction
In this repository, the simulation files that correspond to the paper entitled "Control of wastewater treatment plants using economic-oriented MPC and attention-based RNN disturbance prediction models". The files for the controller implementation are inside the "Controller" folder, the files that represent the inlet flow profiles are in the "Influent Files" folder, the csv files that contain the influent flow rate predictions produced by the RNN models are stored in the "Predictions" folder and the files required for the BSM model are in the "BSM Auxiliary Files" folder.
